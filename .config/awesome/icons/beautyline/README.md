# BeautyLine

BeautyLine icon theme for Garuda Linux.

This is a fork of Beautyline by [sajjad606](https://www.opencode.net/sajjad606).
Also includes icons from [Candy icons](https://github.com/EliverLara/candy-icons) by [EliverLara](https://github.com/EliverLara).

BeautyLine Icon Theme is published under GPLV3 LICENSE @COPYING

Notes:
I'm available via Gmail as written in @AUTHORS, and any participation is most welcome.

The idea of this icon set is to combine stylish icon sets and to create a mix of some other works to create something that my beloved open source community can enjoy, so this is not a complete icon set and some of icons are restyled just to fit the line style and need to redesigned again. 

Although I published the <BeautyLine Icon Theme> under GPLV3, some of the icons in the pack are also available to buy in online stores and IT WOULD BE KIND OF YOU IF YOU WOULD NOT republish it under any other name and within another mod.

Although I try to keep the theme pack updated and add most distro's common icons, you can feel free to add common icons of any kind and publish it by mentioning the name <BeautyLine Icon Theme> and <Sajjad Abdollahzadeh> as author.

Enjoy it and if you have time and interest, help me to get it better ...
